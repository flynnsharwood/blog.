Three little pigs story from the wolf's persective.

It was a very sunny summer day. I was sweating. I was told to bring back the money some pig brothers owed us. Our company seems to be very annoyed at them, as they had sent me, a wolf to bring it back. Anyways, the countryside can be rough. I was so thirsty and almost no place that looked good enough for me. I reached at the first address they provided me with. 
It was a house, made of... dried grass? I was certainly worried about being able to get the money back looking at the stiuation of the place. I knocked on the door anyways. "Little pig, are you there?". No response. I knocked and yelled harder and louder. "yes... uhm... who is it?" The pig replied. "I am here to collect the money you owe us.". "What do you mean I owe you money? I have- uhm.. no money-". I was really annoyed now. I sighed heavily. Too heavily for the house apparently. The house was blown away and the pig was looking at me. He got scared and ran away. "wait-" I shrieked. Not only did I get any basic hospitality that I was in severe need of, neither did I get the money. 
I then went to the next address I was told to go to, in case the first one was abandoned or something, it was the house of the other brother. I reached the place. It was a house made of plywood. Atleast better than grass but like, still, worse than using wood or bricks. I knocked. "Who is it?" the pig answered. "I am here from the company you borrowed money from, and I am here to get it back." I answered. "Oh my god it is the big scary wolf who tore down my house". It was the first pig again who said this. "What the hell are you doing here? also I am sorry for the house being blown away but seriously you needed to have a better one. Also I am really thirsty so I would appreciate some water." The other pig said - "Oh so uhm, about the money, could you try taking it back after a month, cause uh buisness is not really good this moment. I barely have any savings left." I was even more annoyed now. "Sir this is the fifth time you have said that to us. We are sorry but we need the money back, with interest." No response back. I sighed once again and then due to frustration, I kicked the wall slightly. The whole thing fell apart. The two pigs saw me and got scared, and ran away. "Oh come on not again" I sighed. 

I finally went to the oldest brother's house. It was a good brick house. "Finally a well built house!" The wolf thought. He saw that there was a doorbell. He rang the bell. "Yess? How may I help you?". "I'm here for the money you owe me, please open the door". I was already exhausted after the run so I was sighing pretty heavily. Not to mention how much I was already frustrated. "I don't have the money for now, please come back in a month". This was it. I lost my temper. I banged the door and yelled "No, you will be paying whatever you have, right now. You have been giving the same excuse since more than a year now." The other two pigs whimpered. The oldest pig tried to apologise and give excuses, but I was too angry to listen. I warned them to open the door or I would come in anyway. 

"Let's see if you can". This was the sentence when I really lost my temper. I climbed up the chimney and went in. The other two pigs that were already whimpering started to cry. The third pig was a bt scared but not crying or such. He immediately took the rifle beside him and pointed it my way. Luckily it was a rifle which was easy to differentiate if there were bullets in it or not. There weren't any therefore I dashed towards him. He clearly got terrified. He tried to beg for forgiveness but I punched him several times until he was unconsious. I told the other two pigs to either bring the money or watch their brother get eaten before them. It was an easy choice for them. I got the money and left with the oldest brother, still unconsious. No wonder they were annoyed with this case.
