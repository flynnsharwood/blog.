Title- Fragments of Life
Genre- Drama, Tragedy

The boy looked at me, smiled. I gave one of the most cheerful smiles I had, though it wasn't a match for his’. He walked past our car, humming. The face certainly being a thing to be kept in an art showroom. Few seconds later screams and blood surround me. A police car had crashed into the spikes a few steps ahead, and another shady looking car had crashed into our's. The rods kept sideways had stabbed into our windows, through the members tall enough. Had it not been for the pillows we kept in the back seat, I wouldn't have been frozen just temporarily. The boy who went past us was just visible to me, at least what was left. 

The people in red took enough time. I was assumed to be dead by the situation of the car. I don't remember being conscious after that, and before being in the quiet white room. There was a cute little flashing red light, tempting me to reach out and crush it. When I saw the woman enter the room, I tried to ask. Before I could, she started crying and left. There was an old man in the bed beside me. Just an inch away from being a corpse. I didn't want to see the horrific faces of my family again, I just wished them to somehow return back to normal. 

My fractures healed after a whole year. I had been adopted by another family. Getting adopted two times is definitely not a fun experience. My current life is far from what I would have considered perfect, though I don't consider my life right now anywhere near miserable. It's my last year of my education, and yeah, living alone feels a lot better now. I just hope this passiveness doesn't end any time soon.
