I gazed at the highest loop as I fell down. I had jumped too high, higher than the Instrument ever considered to deploy the safe landing mechanism. I could be in troble. I remember what happened to the last one when his emergency apparatus failed. I don't want to even remember. I sent the signal. I was immediately slowed down by the psuedo levitation magic. Just as I landed, I was surrounded with people in awe. Not too much of surprise, considering how I destroyed the previous record by 2 kms more than it.

"Aren't you such a talented boy?" I heard my aunt say it. Ive always hated that word. Undermines all those hundreds of hours I put in. In terms of magic, elemental control has always been a bad part for me. Does it kill them to just directly let us use whatever complex magic we are comfortable with? Anyways I had a slight injury to recover from. A fracture in my legs, actually. They said that it was a calculation mistake they weren't prepared for, and I was assured that this wouldnt happen again. As I got tired of throwing away letters from sponsors, I spent the next hour trying to figure out the problem with my leviating chair (more like a wheelchair). I went to sleep right after that.
