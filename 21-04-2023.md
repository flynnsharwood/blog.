Taichi squealed. He didn't like people running around him and ruining his personal space. He particularly disliked it due to him not knowing when heartseed would apear out of no where and just ruin his life. Heartseed did kind of promise that he won't do any real harm to them, and he was just entertaining himself. 

Taichi saw Inaba coming towards him. She felt different than what she usually is like. She had worn a warm-looking scarf that reminded him that he had forgotten to bring his's. Inaba got to the now - repaired table and opened her bag. She opened her laptop and started typing away as if Taichi didn't even exist. 

It's been kind of boring sine the last incident, don't you think so? Inba? 
Yeah Ig. but not really that much. I feel kind of pumped up for my new investigatory project. what do you mean investigatory project. we don't have one this year. 
uhhh I am using it as an excuse for some power to actually get the t information i want.. anyways where are all the other? is it only you, taichi?

Well i am certain that  iori might be sleeping. she is pretty tired ig. she does look so. anyways I wanted to show you something, look. Taichi got up and rushed in a kind of quick walk or something. Inaba kind of looked cute from that angle actually. anyw

"hey". Inaba yelled. "what are you daydreaming about? "certainly not something weird" he thought to himself. Inabe did some quick strokes o f the keyboard and brought up her file explorer folder where she had kept the memories of us..? It was a folder of pics and videos of all of us. "look at this" inaba prodded Taichi as she tried to bring his attention back to her laptop screen. "this feels out of thething" she said. Taichi saw the pic. He was confused. He didn't know if he should just admit and listen to her taunting, or try to figure it out. He chose the latter."uhmm... did you even realise what's wrong in here?." "Not really ig." Taichi was feeling a bit less confident about himself now. 
So the thing is that this pic selfie feels a bit weird. It has gotou in it. Gotou feels a, like not gotou. I'm not sure what exactly feel wrong, but I think you might want to check it too. Taichi took a closer look at gotou. He seemed a bit weird now that inba had pointed it. 

"HELLLOOOO" the door banged open. It was Iori. she was a little too cheerful for a sick person. Why was she even here to begin with, shouldn't she be in bed? "Are you sure you're supposed to be here? What happened to your cozy bed?" Taichi asked. 
"So uhm I felt quite okay physically, and I was bored. So I decided to come here." 
"So you guys having fun?" she asked. 
"Not really, just looking at this weird looking selfie that has gotou for some reason." Inaba answered. 

Gotou was walking with something that looked like a thin book, but not like a textbook or a notebook. It had some weird cover illustration. A bit weird for something a teacher would be reading. He was also slouching. His body could have been taken over by heartseed. The last incident about their thoughts being loud had resulted in a caos, and definetely something they kind of hated Heartseed even more. 

Iori took a look. "Is it just me, or does it kind of look like heartseed but also not like him? I don't know how to explain but it sure seems like someone else, like hearseed once mentioned before ig?"
Inaba and Taichi gave a shocked glare towards Inaba. She almost completely cleared it up why it looked weird. "Okay so uhm... are you secretly a genius or what, Iori?" Taichi asked, trying to sound jokingly. "Bash" the door was slammed open by yui and the other guy. "So what were we missing?"- Yui asked. "You missed us figuring out that the other heartseed was stalking us"- Taichi said. "Not WE, Iori did". "Uhm I'm gonna need some more context about th-" The other guy was cut off by a shriek in a classroom upstairs.
